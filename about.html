        <h3>About CossiePlay</h3>
            <p>
            	CossiePlay is a family-run business, operating in Hulkstown since 2012.
            </p> 
            <p>
                We create outstanding <a href="costumes.html">custom-made costumes</a>. Cosplayers can order any
                kind of costume - from simple Spiderman or elf costumes right up to costumes including advanced features like armour, animatronics,
                realistic weaponry and working force fields. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Depending on the difficulty, costumes take between 1 and 50 weeks and cost between $10 and $10,000.
                We buy and sell second-hand costumes (<a href="costumes.html">a price list is available</a>) as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the first Saturday of every month we hold a “<a href="parties.html">CossiePlay Party</a>” at the town hall. Entry is $15 for adults, $10
                for ages 6-17 and kids under 6 are free. Each entry includes one non-alcoholic drink and a glow stick. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Parties start at 6pm and run until 11pm. There is always a live DJ at the party (who takes requests) and dancing is common (but not
                required).
