<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Jonathan Cutjar<br>
<strong>Login:</strong> jc325774</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goals of the CossiePlay website are to bring in more revenue for the company by selling more custom-made costumes and encouraging more people to attend the monthly parties held by CossiePlay.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Success of the website can be determined by monitoring the number of orders placed for custom-made costumes, as well as the number of attendees at the monthly parties. To ensure this success isn’t caused by some other factor (word of mouth, etc.) there should be a short survey of party attendees with questions such as “How did you hear about our parties?”</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience for the CossiePlay website is high school kids and young adults (16-23), gender is not a factor in the target audience. The site will target people of those ages through use of pictures featuring individuals of a similar age cosplaying.</p>
